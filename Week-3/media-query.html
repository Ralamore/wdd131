            <p>And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; 
                for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, 
                and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.</p>

            <p>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;
                And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</p>
